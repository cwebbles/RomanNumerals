# RomanNumerals

Here is my solution to the Roman Numerals challenge!

I spent all the time I could on it, I took the whole 4 hours.

I have the working converter from decimals to numerals and numerals to decimals.

I also wrote several tests using JUnit to assert the functionality of my solution.

I included JavaDoc for my <code>RomanNumeralsConverter</code> class.

If I had more time I would've tried to:
<ul>
  <li>Polish up the UI</li>
  <li>Write more tests</li>
  <li>Include a <code>toLowerCase</code> functionality</li>
  <li>Comment my <code>Converter</code> class</li>
  


</ul>

At the moment, the convert will regard lowercase letters as invalid FYI.

Thanks for the chance to solve this problem! I hope you find my solution sufficient.

Hopefully I'll be able to walk through it with you!
